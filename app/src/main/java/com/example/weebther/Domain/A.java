TODO: All notes here

Limit amount of calls. Did 561 on the 17th of Feb only???
    - Everytime I open the app, a call to the API is done. Control it so that it's extracted from the DB instead,
    and not always from the API. Maybe a refresh button? I don't know.
    -

Do not add invalid cities to the CityList.
Back arrow button to go back from CardView details.
